					<h2>Program Overview</h2>

					<h3>Sponsoring Organization</h3>
					<p>Turnover Apartment Painting is a small contracting company of less than 50 employees who serve the multi-family housing industry. The company provides painting and decorating services for corporate management companies located in the greater metro area of Minneapolis and Saint Paul.</p>

					<h3>Program Description</h3>
					<p><span class="blueText"><em>Basic Overview:</em></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following program instructs new employees at Turnover Apartment Painting in the basic skills needed to completely prepare an apartment for paint.  Employees learn the mindset required to work efficiently in a system-based environment, and also how to properly assess an apartment before work begins.  Additionally, trainees learn the skills and techniques needed to properly tape, drape, and prep walls for the painting process.</p>
					<p><span class="blueText"><em>Project AIM</em></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The program reduces the number of incidents on the company complaint queue and increases client satisfaction through a systematic, routine set up of active job sites. Adherence to a system of setup reduces time to job completion, increases profit per unit, and results in fewer training hours per employee.</p>
					
					<h3>Target Audience</h3>
					<p>The target audience consists of new hires enrolled in early Spring on a yearly basis. The average new hire ranges in age from 16 years to 30 years old, and predominantly identifies as male. Average skill level is low (having never worked in manual labor or held employment) to mid-level (having some experience in residential painting).</p>

					<h3>Instructional Problem</h3>
					<p>Turnover Apartment Painting invests significant time training newly hired individuals due to high seasonal employment turnover. As such, management seeks to streamline and reduce costs associated with training new hires. Specifically, the training of new employees in the process of apartment setup results in the greatest return on investment. The relative ease in training fundamental setup skills translates to fewer hours spent training employees to the basic standard, and a reduced prevalence of errors later in the painting process.</p>
					<div id="secondpoint"></div>
					<h3>Program Intervention and Delivery</h3>
					
					<p>The program utilizes a hybrid model consisting of web-based multimedia and in-person training. Basic concepts (such as formulating a &ldquo;one-way&rdquo; setup mentality, using appropriate equipment, etc.) are taught asynchronously on a web-based learning platform. Trainers conduct fine motor adjustments and jobsite orientation one-on-one or in small groups to affirm that the new hires demonstrate appropriate technique for specific micro skills.</p>

					<h2>Alignment</h2>
					<h3>Alignment Overview</h3>
					<p>According to Pearson (2016), alignment &ldquo;. . . refers to a high degree of agreement among the objectives, assessments, and the content in a learning experience.&rdquo; Stated another way, alignment is the path that connects learning activities and assessments to objectives, which connect again with the overall goals of instruction.</p>
					<p>Learning activities and assessments should practically address the objectives in well designed instruction. For instance, a written exam would likely not align well with the objective of teaching a performance-based skill. Likewise, an original piece of art created by a student may not be the most appropriate activity for memorization of dates or facts.</p>

					<h3>Project Alignment</h3>
					<div id="thirdpoint"></div>
					<p>This program&rsquo;s hybrid design grants a high degree of flexibility in addressing the overall goal of instruction. Web-based media presentations in combination with one-on-one in-person instruction ensures the learner receives training that will prepare them to meet the objectives of each module. Assessments given through online quizzes and performance-based activities measure each learners&rsquo; progress while they engage with the program.</p>

						<h2>Assessment</h2>
						<h3>Assessment Overview</h3>
						<p>This program features ongoing assessment delivered online and in-person.  All assessments delivered in-person serve as both assessments and activities that the trainee completes multiple times throughout the training process.  The learner has access to repeat online quizzes as many times as they wish.  In-person assessments are repeated as many times as needed to meet the objectives of each module.  Trainees do not receive a formal grade on any assessment, but each trainer evaluates the need for continued assessment based on trainee achievement of objective standards.</p>
						<h3>Assessment Plan</h3>
						<p><span class="blueText"><em>Multiple-choice, True/False and graphical in-picture selections.</em></span><br>
						Administration of these short, simple quizzes follow online presentations through the online learning platform. Feedback for each answer is presented at the conclusion of the question, along with a reason why the trainee answered correctly or incorrectly. The learner can take the quizzes as many times as they like, but they must answer all questions correctly to continue with the presentations. As each quiz consists of between one and three measures, most trainees should perform at this level by the second or third try.</p>
						<p><span class="blueText"><em>Iterative feedback.</em></span><br> The assessment utilizes a feedback loop between trainer and trainee that iterates over multiple apartments. The trainer provides a selection of single sentence cues in every new apartment that elicits a verbal response or demonstration from the trainee. The trainee receives feedback from the trainer regarding their performance, and the process begins again at the start of the next apartment. As the trainee learns, the trainer gradually fades the cues until the trainee achieves competence based on the objective.</p>
						<p><span class="blueText"><em>Mock role-reversal.</em></span><br>  The assessment occurs between trainer and trainee. Each performance-based enabling objective requires the trainee to demonstrate a basic hands-on skill. After sufficient practice, the trainer will assess the trainee&rsquo;s learning by asking the trainee to guide the trainer through the task. Having the trainee teach the skill cements the learning through metacognition and provides the trainee a sense of accomplishment.</p>

						<h3>Assessment Examples</h3>
						<div class= "exampleCard">
						<p><span class="blueText blueTextTitle"><em>Multiple-choice.</em></span><br></p>
							<p><span class="blueText">Question: Angela just started working at Turnover Apartment Painting, and she doesn&rsquo;t know which direction she should tape the baseboard. Angela is right-handed. Which direction should she tape?</span></p>
							<p>A. Right to left.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="grayText">(<em>Feedback</em>: Sorry, incorrect.  Remember: the correct direction depends on your dominant hand.)</span><br>
							B. Left to right.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="grayText">(<em>Feedback</em>: Correct! A right-handed person would tape from the left to right.  A left-handed person tapes right to left.)</span><br>
							C. Either direction.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="grayText">(<em>Feedback</em>: Sorry, incorrect.  If you are ambidextrous you may choose either direction, but Angela is right-handed.)</span><br>
							</p>

							<p>---&ldquo;How far away should your knees be from the baseboard when you begin taping?&rdquo;</p>
							<p>---&ldquo;Where do you put the equipment bag when you enter the apartment?&rdquo;</p>

					<h2>Training Activities</h2>
					
					<h3>Activity Overview</h3>
					<p>Activities utilized for this project fall under the general principles found in Horton&rsquo;s (2011) work titled E-learning by Design. Horton (2011) breaks activities into three categories: absorb-type, do-type, and connect-type activities. The boundaries of these activities touch or encompass assessment activities, which the reader of this project will note in the provided alignment chart. The general definitions of these activities are as follows:</p>
					<p><span class="blueText">Absorb Activities:</span> Absorb activities involve passive learning on the part of the learner. Examples of absorb-type activities include lectures or presentations, reading assignments, and field trips (Horton, 2011). The learner engages with the content through listening or observation.</p>
					<p><span class="blueText">Do Activities:</span> Do-type activities require active participation of the learner (Horton, 2011). Examples of do-type activities include practice or drill activities, and discovery activities. The learner directly engages with the content by practicing an activity or concept, or through self-directed discovery.</p>
					<p><span class="blueText">Connect Activities:</span> Connect activities integrate learning with broader ideas outside the immediate course or module (Horton, 2011). Connect activities provide context and extend learning beyond the immediate task. Examples of connect activities include &ldquo;ponder&rdquo; exercises (where learner considers what they learned), research activities, job aides, and original work. In these activities the learner takes information and utilizes it in a larger context.</p>

					<h3>Training Example</h3>
					<div class="exampleCard">
						<p><span class="blueText blueTextTitle">Terminal Objective:</span></p>
						<p>Given an understanding of ceiling paint needs in a two-bedroom/two-bathroom apartment, the trainee lays drop cloths in the appropriate locations using proper technique learned in demonstrations. The trainee will complete the task in under twenty minutes, ensuring that all surfaces requiring coverage receive coverage.</p>
						
						<p><span class="blueText">Absorb-type Activity #1:</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;The trainee watches an online demonstration that shows the correct drape placement and placement technique for apartments that require ceiling paint and for those that do not require ceiling paint.</p>
						<p><span class="blueText">Absorb-type Activity #2:</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;The trainee observes the trainer demonstrate correct drape placement and technique on the physical job site.</p>
						<p><span class="blueText">Do-type Activity #1:</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;The trainee drapes the entire apartment with guidance from the trainer.  They perform the activity for apartments that require ceiling paint and for those that do not require ceiling paint.</p>
						<p><span class="blueText">Do-type Activity #2:</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;The trainee utilizes an online graphical interface to demonstrate the appropriate locations to put drop cloths. The trainee clicks on an birds-eye view layout of an apartment to indicate where they think drops should be placed.  Each click recieves graphical feedback.</p>
						<div id="fifthpoint"></div>
						<p><span class="blueText">Connect-type Activity #1:</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;The trainee engages in a mock role-reversal activity where they "teach" the trainer how to drape an apartment for ceilings and for those that do not require ceilings.</p>
						<p><span class="blueText">Connect-type Activity #2:</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;The trainee has access to a paper job aide that shows the position of drapes in a two-bedroom/two-bathroom apartment from a birds-eye layout view.</p>
